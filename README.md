# Visualizing-Data-with-Plotly
Plotly is a python graphing library used to create dynamic, publishable graphs. It enables users to stream, copy, and import data for analysis and visualization.

I was able to perform the following in this experiment:

1.	Complete the fundamentals of Plotly's exploratory data analysis and install it on my colab notebook.

2.	Use plotly to import the relevant libraries and view the data using basic and multi-line plots with various markers.

3.	Utilize plotly to visualize data using bar plots, area charts, and stacked area charts.

4.	Utilize Plotly to visualize data with Pie Charts and Multilevel Pie Charts.

5.	Utilize Plotly to visualize data using a scatter plot.
